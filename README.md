# OSProject3
---------------------------------------------------------

## Division of Labor
*Scott Early*:       cd, mv, read, cp
  
*Steven Starnes*:    info, size, ls, write, rm

*Taylor Driver*:     creat, mkdir, open, close

## Contents of Tar
*project3.c* - our file containing main, all functions and all functions' definitions

*makefile*

*README.md*

*fat32.img*  -our imagefile

## Compilation Instructions
simply type "make" and then use the executable "project3"

## Known Bugs\Unfinished Portions
We have correctly been able to retrieve information from the fat32 image file and have done all error checking for our functions. We however, unfortunately, were unable to complete much of the project functions

*cp, mv, and read*: only do error checking


## Special Considerations
